**Fruit Fly Fix

It is breakfast time. You have been looking forward to

eating a nice ripe banana ever since you woke up. Just when

you reach for the delicious piece of fruit on your counter, you

see something that makes you much less hungry: a swarm of

fruit flies!

Fruit flies are tiny insects that are attracted to ripe or

rotting fruits and vegetables. The flies not only eat the fruit,

they also lay their eggs there. A single fruit fly can lay up to

500 eggs on the surface of a piece of fruit. Within eight days,

the fruit flies that hatch from these eggs are full adults that can

then lay their own eggs. As you can see, what might start out

as a small fruit fly problem can become very large very quickly.

Although there is a chance fruit flies can carry germs on to your food, this is not very likely. Fruit

flies are annoying, but they probably will not hurt you. Because they are such a nuisance, however, most

people want to get rid of these pesky bugs as quickly as possible. Some people use pesticide sprays on

the fruit flies. Although this will kill the flies, it will also spread harmful poison all over your kitchen. Luckily,

there is also a completely safe way for you to get rid of fruit flies in your house.

The first step is for you to remove all fruits or vegetables from your counter. Store these items in

the refrigerator or in sealed containers. Clean up any spilled juice or bits of food that might be on the floor.

Take out the trash and empty the recycling bin. Wash any dirty dishes that are in your sink. Doing all of

these things will stop new fruit flies from finding food or places to lay their eggs.

Next, make a trap to catch all of the remaining fruit flies in your house. First, fill a small bowl with

a few tablespoons of vinegar. Then, put a piece of very ripe or rotting fruit into the vinegar. Cover the bowl

very tightly with a sheet of plastic wrap and poke a few very small holes in the wrap with a fork. If all goes

according to plan, the flies will enter the trap through the holes but will be unable to fly back out. This trap

will catch all of the remaining fruit flies. You can either kill these flies or release them outdoors.

Fruit flies can be a pest, but they do not have to make you crazy. With a little effort, you can get

existing flies out of your house and prevent new ones from taking over your kitchen. **
