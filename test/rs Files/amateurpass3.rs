**The Rio Grande

Although not the longest river in America, the Rio Grande is one

of the most important. But, unlike other significant rivers, it is not used

for shipping. In fact, oceangoing ships cannot navigate the waters. No,

what makes the Rio Grande so important is its location. Since 1846, it

has been the official border of Texas and Mexico.

Rio Grande Geography

The Rio Grande is either the fourth or fifth longest river system

in North America. It all depends on how it is measured. Because the

river twists so much, it occasionally changes course. And these course shifts can cause it to be longer or

shorter. At its last official measure, the Rio Grande clocked in at 1,896 miles. The river starts in Colorado

and extends downward to the Gulf of Mexico.

Downward is the best way of describing it too. Not only does the river extend south, but it also

starts in the mountains and gets lower and lower in elevation as it extends to the Gulf.

Its name is Spanish for the “Big River,” but the Rio Grande is actually known as Rio Bravo in

Mexico. “Bravo” translates as “furious,” so the name makes sense. Because of its twists and turns, it

certainly does seem to be angrier than most rivers!

The Rio Grande Today

The Rio Grande today is mostly used as a source of drinking water. Sadly, much of the water has

been drained from the river. Parts of the river are almost dry! This is because people use more water from

the river than the river can get back from rain and other sources. Experts are working to correct this,

though, with hopes of restoring the river to its past strength.

Today, the river is important as a source of water for Texans and Mexicans. More important, it is

a symbol of cooperation between two nations. Though borders like the Rio Grande separate nations, they

are also shared spaces. The Rio Grande is therefore a symbol of friendship and peace between two

people **
